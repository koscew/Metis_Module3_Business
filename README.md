# Metis_Module3_Regression_Project
## Descripton

This is the third project of Metis Data Science Bootcamp. We're going to deliver a well-scoped project proposal and preliminary analysis to the target client to try to get the foot in the door. I will deliver a well-scoped project proposal and preliminary analysis to struggling nursing facilities with low occupancy to let them understand and accept how data science can help them increase the occupancy.
